# REVERSE-ENGINEERING 14 INFO MILLIONAIRE'S FUNNELS

![Cover image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HA7cVcGaYAEhbyS.jpg)

i reverse-engineered 14 info millionaires' funnels last week

russell brunson, alex hormozi, iman gadzhi, dan koe, justin welsh, sam ovens, all of them

they're all selling the exact same fucking thing in different fonts

and you're over here trying to "find your unique angle"

bro there is no unique angle

there's only ONE funnel architecture that works at scale

and everyone making $1M+ is running the same exact system with minor cosmetic variations

here's what i found after deconstructing their entire customer journey

STAGE 1: FREE VALUE THAT DEMONSTRATES COMPETENCE

not motivational bullshit, not surface-level tips

DEEP tactical content that proves "this person knows what they're talking about"

hormozi: free youtube videos breaking down exact business frameworks dan koe: twitter threads with complete systems given away justin welsh: linkedin posts teaching his actual methodology sam ovens: free training videos showing his consulting model

they're not gatekeeping the "how"

they're giving away 80% of the knowledge for free

why this works:

demonstrates expertise without claiming it

builds trust through value delivery

creates "if the free stuff is this good, imagine the paid stuff" effect

filters audience to people who actually implement

most of you are doing the opposite

hoarding your "secrets" behind paywalls

wondering why nobody trusts you enough to buy

meanwhile they're teaching EVERYTHING openly and printing millions

STAGE 2: LEAD MAGNET THAT SOLVES ONE SPECIFIC PROBLEM

not "download my guide to success" - vague garbage

"download my $10M revenue formula" - specific outcome

hormozi: "$100M offers" book (basically free, covers shipping only) brunson: "dotcom secrets" book (free + shipping) dan koe: "2 hour writer" guide justin welsh: "the saturday solopreneur system"

every single one follows the same formula:

solve ONE problem completely make it free or nearly free ($7-$12 for shipping/processing) deliver so much value they feel guilty not buying more position the paid products as natural next step

the lead magnet isn't revenue

it's QUALIFICATION

they're identifying people who:

consume content (not just collect it)

take action on free stuff

have the problem their paid products solve

are willing to exchange email for value

anyone who gets the lead magnet and implements it becomes a warm lead

STAGE 3: EMAIL SEQUENCE THAT BUILDS BELIEF SYSTEM

this is where most people fuck up

they get the email and immediately pitch

"buy my course buy my course buy my course"

the millionaires do something completely different

they send 7-21 emails that systematically shift beliefs:

email 1-3: more free value (case studies, frameworks, stories) email 4-6: destroy limiting beliefs ("you don't need more time, you need better systems") email 7-9: introduce new mechanism ("the reason your current approach fails is X, here's Y") email 10-12: social proof (other people's results using the new mechanism) email 13-15: future pacing (what life looks like after implementing) email 16-18: first soft pitch (invitation to paid product) email 19-21: objection handling and urgency

they're not selling a product

they're selling a NEW WAY OF THINKING

because once you believe their philosophy, buying their product is logical

hormozi: "volume solves all problems" → buy paid products to increase volume dan koe: "become a digital entrepreneur" → buy products to build digital business

 justin welsh: "boring profitable business" → buy templates to build boring business

the philosophy IS the product positioning

STAGE 4: PRODUCT LADDER FROM $7 TO $50,000

every single one has the same ascending structure

tier 1: $7-$97 - tactical guide or mini course tier 2: $297-$997 - comprehensive program tier 3: $2,000-$10,000 - coaching or mastermind tier 4: $15,000-$50,000+ - done-with-you or partnership

hormozi:

books ($0-40)

acquisition.com courses ($499-999)

licensing program ($15k-30k)

brunson:

books ($7-20)

one funnel away ($100)

funnel hacking live ($3k)

inner circle ($50k/year)

dan koe:

2 hour writer ($0)

digital economics ($297)

modern mastery ($997)

consulting (unknown, probably $5k+)

the structure is IDENTICAL across all of them

low-ticket frontend (customer acquisition) mid-ticket program (profit center) high-ticket backend (wealth generation)

they all understood the same math:

you can't scale to $10M selling only $2000 products you need backend offers at $10k+ to create big revenue from small customer counts

STAGE 5: COMMUNITY OR CONTINUITY LAYER

this is the retention mechanism that compounds LTV

after someone buys the mid or high ticket offer, they get invited to:

ongoing community (discord, circle, skool) monthly Q&A calls updated content and resources peer support and networking continuous engagement

why this matters:

keeps customers in ecosystem (harder to churn) creates referral engine (community members recruit others) justifies recurring revenue ($97-497/month memberships) increases lifetime value from $997 to $5,000+

hormozi doesn't just sell acquisition.com he sells ongoing access to the community and calls

brunson doesn't just sell clickfunnels he sells funnel hacker community membership

the community isn't an add-on

it's a MOAT that prevents customers from leaving and makes competitors irrelevant

STAGE 6: OMNIPRESENT CONTENT MACHINE

every single one is EVERYWHERE

not just posting on one platform

multi-platform content distribution:

youtube: long-form educational content twitter/x: daily insights and engagement linkedin: professional thought leadership instagram: lifestyle and social proof podcast: deep dives and interviews email: regular direct communication

they're not "picking one platform and going deep"

they're going deep on ALL platforms simultaneously

because omnipresence = authority

when someone sees you on youtube, then twitter, then linkedin, then podcast

they don't think "this person posts a lot"

they think "this person is everywhere, they must be important"

and they achieve this through LEVERAGE:

one piece of core content (youtube video, podcast episode) gets repurposed into:

10 twitter threads

5 linkedin posts

20 instagram stories

3 blog posts

12 short-form videos

1 hour of content creation = 50+ pieces of distributed content

they're not working harder, they're working SYSTEMATICALLY

THE ACTUAL DIFFERENTIATION (it's not what you think)

so if they're all using the same funnel structure, what makes them different?

NOT their unique methodology (they're all teaching similar principles)

NOT their funnel design (literally same structure)

NOT their pricing (all within similar ranges)

the differentiation is three things:

PERSONALITY AND BRAND

hormozi: analytical, data-driven, no-bullshit operator dan koe: philosophical, big-picture, creative entrepreneur

 brunson: energetic, marketing-obsessed, funnel nerd justin welsh: calm, systematic, boring-business advocate

same structure, different ENERGY

people don't buy the funnel, they buy the PERSON

NICHE POSITIONING

hormozi: service business owners doing $1M-10M dan koe: creators and solopreneurs building digital business brunson: entrepreneurs who want to sell online justin welsh: corporate employees wanting to escape

same product ladder, different TARGET AUDIENCE

PROOF AND CREDIBILITY

hormozi: sold gym launch for 8 figures, manages $200M+ portfolio dan koe: built multiple 7-figure businesses as solopreneur brunson: built $100M+ clickfunnels company justin welsh: exited two companies, built to $5M solo

same mechanism, different CREDENTIALS

the structure is universal

the execution is personal

what this means for you

stop trying to invent a new funnel architecture

the architecture that works is already proven

14 people making $1M-100M+ are using the EXACT SAME STRUCTURE

your job isn't to reinvent it

your job is to IMPLEMENT it with your personality, niche, and proof

here's what you do right now:

step 1: create free value that demonstrates competence (youtube, twitter, linkedin)

step 2: build lead magnet that solves one specific problem for your niche

step 3: write email sequence that shifts beliefs and introduces your mechanism

step 4: create product ladder: $47 frontend → $497 program → $2997 coaching

step 5: add community layer for retention and LTV expansion

step 6: distribute content omnipresently through repurposing

this is not theory bro

this is the EXACT BLUEPRINT that's generated over $500M in combined revenue for these operators

and you have access to all of it for free

because they're not hiding the structure

they're executing it in public

the only question is whether you're going to keep overthinking and "finding your unique angle"

or whether you're going to take the proven architecture and execute it with YOUR personality for YOUR niche

stop being creative with structure

be creative with EXECUTION

the funnel is solved

now go fucking build it

i build info product businesses for people who have knowledge but no infrastructure. if that's you, DM "ARBITRAGE" @imsehej
